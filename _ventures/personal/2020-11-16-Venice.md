# Where I work

I wake up at 4 am...

I need to catch the line by 5:20-5:30 am because it would take half an hour plus to get on the bus. I need to be at the next terminal by at least 6:30 am.

I cross here to get to my office.

Or here...

I eat here during lunch if I'm not overloaded.

It is nice to stroll around...

Getting home... you have to wait at least 30 minutes for the shuttle to arrive.

Then you get to cross here everynight

before you're queued up again for your bus ride home.
