_If I love you_<br>
I will give you the freedom to discover the world<br>
Your compassion and kindness, I am beholden to<br>
Outperform the Ogygia at nine in the afternoon<br>

_If I loved you_<br>
Oh the questions I do ask myself of intrepid failures<br>
To prosper you in mirth that shines in golden tune<br>
It was ever thus, I shoot for the moon<br>

_If I really love you_<br>
Why am I wondering<br>
Of the best that I bring?<br>
I think I still lack<br>
Why am I gelt, uncouth, aback?<br>
In the face of responsibilities<br>
Why do I slack?<br>
I sabotage myself if I desist<br>
Of all the effort I made, still all feels amiss<br>

_If I really love you_<br>
So much I don’t qualify<br>
Even by my own standards<br>
To oneself, should vilify<br>
Why I haven’t shown perfection?<br>
Perfect is not enough<br>
To whom did I give my 99% to<br>

If it’s not for you?

How selfish am I?
