# [D O G]ᵗ

Some people are like dogs.

Have no one else to choose from except you.

Have nothing else to depend on except you.

Have been exhausted struggling alone.

Have strayed in the world for a long time.

Have no one to inquire from except you.

Have no one to learn from except you.

Have nothing to look for except you.

Have been in too much discomfort.

Have given too much obeisance to survive.

Have been afraid to lose you.

Have been getting fat.

Have been getting old.

Have been forsaken.

Have no one to confess to except you.

Have been complacent in you.

Have been forgiven only by you.

Have been given a place by you.

Have no one to take love from except you.

Have no one to give love to except you.

Have no reasons to give love to.

Have been always loving you.
