With scale turning high
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Magnitude tricks the eye<br>
The force needed to lift<br>
Does on the brows drifts<br>
As distance stretches<br>
Some potency will fetch<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That is the tempest<br>
A phenomenon<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Observed between chests<br>
A drag force upon<br>
The waltz of our jest<br>
So gently it clings<br>
Forfeits, then, the skin<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Unnoticed by sense<br>
The then accrued flight<br>
As distance occurred heightens<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That’s why it is wise<br>
To start from the toes<br>
Climbing to the thighs<br>
With your instrument<br>
Of palate and polite<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And just as the scale<br>
When it tricks the eye<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You’d be just as surprised<br>
At the climax<br>
Of your flight.<br>
