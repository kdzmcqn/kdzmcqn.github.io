With scale turning high
















Magnitude tricks the eye
The force needed to lift
Does on the brows drifts
As distance stretches
Some potency will fetch













That is the tempest
A phenomenon













Observed between chests
A drag force upon
The waltz of our jest
So gently it clings
Forfeits, then, the skin













Unnoticed by sense
The then accrued flight
As distance occurred heightens













That’s why it is wise
To start from the toes
Climbing to the thighs
With your instrument
Of palate and polite
















And just as the scale
When it tricks the eye
















You’d be just as surprised
At the climax
Of your flight.
