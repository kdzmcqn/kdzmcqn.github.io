# Someone

Summer solstice girl, you have poured love into my life
The girl that has been bothering me, she doesn't have an interest in me. You know who I'm talking about.

# December
Now I have the time to work on my backlogs since it's the holidays. I should be reading thousands of pages of law-related things. I hate the law. But as Marie Curie quoted:
>Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.

Hence, I am trying to understand the study of law better. Most of the time, due to my ineptness, I couldn't grasp the idea of arbitrary meanderings.
I'm trying my best not to bother but I find myself seeking refuge to you. I know we ought to learn to be independent, but all my life I always have been. 

It has become emptiness.

I'm trying to create a balance between accepting this isolation and healthy social life.
I have things I love to work on. I can study all by myself. I could write papers. I wanted to send it off and publish them I only I could find the right people to work with. Right now, I don't think I have a chance even if I tried.

I found this quote back in 2013 written by Cicero. It is one of my favorite. This has pushed me past my limits and made me give my all. I still have a lot of things to improve on but I have always been acting on this.

>In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business, it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
