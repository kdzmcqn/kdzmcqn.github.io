i finally found a common ground. what it meant to be a writer. years ago i thought it was just part of my personality to perceive things and patters

just a few weeks back. i just can't believe you have a kind of spontanity that i have. i just can't believe it. how frequent does one
encounter such a person like yourself? 

i tried questioning how you got into that. it has always been in my mind. not only that occasion. on many as well. how could i forget? your nimble mind amazes me. now i know the answer: you are a true writer. thank you for teaching me.
